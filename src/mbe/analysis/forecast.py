"""3-year scenario forecast: what could this stock be worth in three years?

The v0.1 valuation moved exactly one knob between bull, base and bear (growth,
by a factor of 1.2) while sharing a deliberately-haircut base cash flow, so
every scenario told the same pessimistic story. This module instead projects
revenue and net margin separately, applies an exit multiple anchored to what
peers and the stock's own history actually trade at, and guards both ends:
neither the input nor any single scenario is allowed to carry all the
conservatism or all the optimism.

Cross-sectional by nature — the peer anchor needs a screened universe — so it
runs as a post-pass over completed bundles, the same contract as
analysis/sector.py. On the single-ticker path the peer term is simply absent
and PriceForecast.completeness records it.
